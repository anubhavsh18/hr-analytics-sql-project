# HR Analytics SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes an employee HR dataset using SQL.  
The objective was to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow: first clean the raw data and then answer business questions using SQL queries.

The project is divided into two parts:
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
2. Business Analysis & Insights
